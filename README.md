## other useful tools
- [UFW](https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UFW) -  default firewall configuration tool for Ubuntu
- [anything-sync-daemon (asd)](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Anything-sync-daemon) is a tiny pseudo-daemon
designed to manage user specified directories referred to as sync targets from here on out, in tmpfs
and to periodically sync them back to the physical disc (HDD/SSD).
This is accomplished via a symlinking step and an innovative use of rsync to maintain synchronization
between a tmpfs copy and media-bound backups. Additionally, asd features several crash recovery features.
